# STAT2_LifeExpectancyProject
Regression Project with Kaggle Life Expectancy Dataset


## Objective 1: Display the ability to build regression models using the skills and discussions from Unit 1 and 2 with the purpose of identifying key relationships and interpreting those relationships.



## Objective 2:  While your model from Objective 1 may be interpretable there may be some additional complexity that you could incorporate to your model so that it can predict better at the expense of interpretations.  The purpose of this objective is to go through a process to compare multiple models with the goal of developing a model that can predict the best and do well on future data.
